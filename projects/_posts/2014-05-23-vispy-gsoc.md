title: Vispy - Google Summer of Code 2014
---

I participated in Google Summer of Code 2014 as a contributor to [Vispy](http://www.vispy.org), a sub-organization under the umbrella of Python Software Foundation. Vispy is an awesome scientific visualization library written in Python and uses OpenGL. 

My project required me to implement Visuals layer and related functionality in Vispy. My work involved extending the visuals API with new visuals and examples along with tests. More details on my project are available here - [GSoC proposal](http://goo.gl/lwnVeh).
