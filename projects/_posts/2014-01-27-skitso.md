title: Skitso - A painting assistant system
---

As part of MIT Media Lab Design and Innovate Workshop 2014, India, my team and I designed and implemented a system that uses a projector, a camera and simple image processing to assist kids and students in drawing pictures. The system takes an image, breaks it down into simple steps
and projects it onto a drawable surface while monitoring the progress of the painter. An early version of the code is available [here](https://github.com/mssurajkaiga/drawno)

We were guided by Nikhil Naik and Ermal Dreshaj from MIT Media Lab.
