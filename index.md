I am a final year Engg. undergrad at [BITS Pilani Goa](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a flavour of Computer Science. 

My research interests broadly lie in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. In particular, I have a very keen interest in photo-realistic rendering and GPGPU and generally enjoy anything that exploits GPUs.

I am originally from a [beautiful village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudayathoor) in Kerala but have lived most of my life in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant ([Kaiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiga_Atomic_Power_Station)).

Here's a picture with a few friends:
