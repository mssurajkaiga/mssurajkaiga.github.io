Hi, I am a final year Engg. undergrad at [BITS Pilani Goa](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a flavour of Computer Science. I am originally from a [beautiful village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudayathoor) in Kerala but have lived most of my life in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant ([Kaiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiga_Atomic_Power_Station)). I like science fiction (books/movies) and coding.

I enjoy open-source and was a Google Summer of Code 2014 student contributing to [Vispy](http://www.vispy.org) - an awesome scientific visualization library in Python. More details on my project are available here - [http://goo.gl/lwnVeh](http://goo.gl/lwnVeh).

I am interested in the field of Computer Graphics, particularly photo-realistic rendering and real-time rendering.
