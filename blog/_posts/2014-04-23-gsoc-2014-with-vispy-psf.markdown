My proposal for Vispy (participating under the umbrella of Python Software Foundation) has been accepted for this year's edition of Google Summer of Code. Here's my proposal - [http://goo.gl/lwnVeh](http://goo.gl/lwnVeh). I will be mentored by Luke Campagnola and Nicolas Rougier.

[Vispy](http://vispy.org) is an OpenGL based scientific visualization library written in Python. I am really excited to work on Vispy during the summer - after all, Numpy + OpenGL = Simply Awesome!

Currently, as part of Community Bonding period, I am familiarizing myself with the Visuals architecture and testing it out with some simple examples. I will be posting further updates on my progress on this blog, around once a week.
